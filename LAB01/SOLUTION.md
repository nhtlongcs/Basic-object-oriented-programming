In this lab, I implemented a class to handle colorized text for multi purposes (such as error logging). Another one is Error to manage the error code through the workflow. Both of them using singleton pattern. I used a function pointer to remove duplicate task in finding especial type of input numbers, by pass it to execution function to check satify called predicate. In summary, logger and errorer will manage error of the whole code.
